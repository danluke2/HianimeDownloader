# HiAnime Downloader

A tool forked from https://github.com/gheatherington/HianimeDownloader with HiAnime focused improvements. I did not test this code against other media platforms. Some key additions are as follows:

- Threading to allow concurrent episode downloads
- Config file to specify defaults and minimize user input
- Error handling to prevent program crashes

Original Overview:

```
A simple CLI tool for downloading content from the streaming platform [hianime.to](hianime.to) + [social media platfroms](#supported-platforms). \
This tool works best if you have a VPN installed with Adblock support, as I have not been able to get a working ad
blocker working with the chrome session.
```


## Requirements

- Python3 + PIP3
- Chrome Installed

## Setup

1. Download the files from the repository.

2. Navigate into the directory it was downloaded to in your terminal.
3. Using pip install all the requirement from the `requirements.txt` file.
   - For Windows

     ```bash
      pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

   - For Linux/macOS you may have to first create a virtual environment, so use the following commands.

     ```bash
     python3 -m venv .venv
     source .venv/bin/activate
     python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

4. You are now ready to run the program with the following command.
   - Windows

     ```bash
      python main.py
     ```

   - Linux/MacOS

     ```bash
      python3 main.py
     ```

## Usage

- After running the `main.py` file, enter the name of the anime you would like to search for
  from [hianime.to](hianime.to) or provide a link to the content you would like to download

- If you provided a link you will jump to either the [Downloading from HiAnime](#downloading-from-hianime) 

- If you enter a name of an anime it will bring up a selection of anime options from the site, select the desired one with the corresponding number.

- follow prompts as necessary to download desired number of episodes in desired format

<!-- - **Note** if a redirect ad to a second tab is created, close the second tab manually and refresh the original site to
  continue download. (This will hopefully be patched eventually) -->



## Options

You are able to pass parameters when running the file to add additional options.

- `-o` or `--output-dir` lets you provide a path for the output files. For example,

  ```bash
  python3 main.py -o ~/Movies/
  ```

- `-l` or `--link` allows you to pass in a link to the content you want to download

- `-n` or `--filename` allows you to pass in the name of the anime you are looking for, or the filename for the downloaded content from [other platforms](#supported-platforms)

- `--no-subtitles` downloads the content without looking for subtitle files

- `--server` allows you to select the streaming server you would like to downlaod from.

- `--aria` uses the aria2c downloader for yt-dlp to download the content (untested)


### Usage Example

```bash
python3 main.py -o ~/Desktop/ --server "HD-1" -n "Solo Leveling" --no-subtitles

```

## Default Configuration

You can customize default behaviors by editing the `config.json` file. This allows you to avoid repetitive prompts and streamline your downloads. Here are the available configuration options:

### Configuration Options

- **`default_server`**: Set a list of preferred streaming servers in priority order. The tool will try each server in sequence until it finds an available one. If none are available, you'll be prompted to choose.
  - Example: `"default_server": ["HD-1", "HD-3", "HD-2"]`
  - Set to `null` or `[]` to always prompt for server selection

- **`default_download_type`**: Set your preferred download type (`"sub"` or `"dub"`). When both are available, this choice will be used automatically. If only one type is available, that one will be used regardless of this setting.
  - Example: `"default_download_type": "dub"`
  - Set to `null` to always prompt when both sub and dub are available

- **`download_all`**: When set to `true`, automatically downloads all episodes without prompting for a range.
  - Example: `"download_all": true`
  - Default: `false`

- **`subtitles`**: When set to `true`, downloads subtitle files (.vtt or .srt) along with the video.
  - Default: `true`

- **`srt_format`**: When set to `true`, converts downloaded .vtt subtitle files to .srt format.
  - Default: `false`

- **`output_dir`**, **`movie_output_dir`**, **`ova_output_dir`**: Customize the default output directories for different content types.

### Example Configuration

```json
{
  "subtitles": true,
  "output_dir": "/Users/yourname/Anime",
  "movie_output_dir": "/Users/yourname/Movies",
  "ova_output_dir": "/Users/yourname/OVAs",
  "default_server": ["HD-1", "HD-3", "HD-2"],
  "default_download_type": "dub",
  "download_all": true,
  "srt_format": false
}
```

With this configuration, the tool will:
- Automatically use dub when available
- Try HD-1 first, then HD-3, then HD-2 for streaming
- Download all episodes without asking for a range
- Save files to your specified directories
- Download subtitles in .vtt format

**Note**: Folder naming automatically adapts to your `default_download_type`. If you set `"dub"` as default, dub folders won't have "(Dub)" appended to their names. Sub folders will still show "(Sub)" to distinguish them.
